# System Dynamics Simulation Analysis of NYC Transportation Carbon Emission Data
### Data
System Dynamics modeling and analyses are conducted based on the CATChain-R platform using New York Cityâ€™s transportation carbon emission data from 2005 to 2022, which can also be checked by https://climate.cityofnewyork.us/initiatives/nyc-greenhouse-gas-inventories/.

### Method
The VensimPLE software was used in the development of the diagram. This software is among a variety of packages (Stella, i-think, Powersim, and DYNAMO) capable of high-level simulation.
