# Evaluation Analysis of MOVES Data
Repository for analysis and visualization of MOVES emissions data.
# Overview
Here you can access and visualize the data collected from U.S. Environmental Protection Agency using Motor Vehicle Emissions Simulation tool (MOVES). In this repository there are two datasets named "all_countiesby16.csv" and "cleaned_c02_data_non_va_wv.csv" respectively. The first is raw data collected using the EPA's Motor Vehicle Emissions Simulation Tool alongside estimated inputs. The second is the processed data after removing the extreme data from Virginia and West Virginia and filling in missing data. The "evaluation_analysis.py" file contains functions to generate histograms of emissions in different years as well as plots of aggregate emissions over time under different scenarios.
